I hope I never have to read this back. If I do, it will be one of the last things I do. Or it might be a hasty look back on 
what once seemed like an insurmountable task. A Sisyphean one, even though I only read the first 9 pages of that. Some nerve making light jokes considering being on the verge of suicide but that must be a slither of hope peaking out which I am not sure what effect will have on my future self reading this. Best bet would be on some sort of self hate and here is my pessimistic outlook peaking out. This back and forth is kind of tiring after a while but that only fuels the hating which is a familiar feeling hence one that sticks around.

Speaking of sticky things, blood is very sticky. Rivers of blood appear out of nowhere drowning all life but mainly me. People are swimming in it but I'll stop now because even this surreal image brings an eerie panicky feeling.

Is it safe now? I am tearing up writing this but I hope you feel safe now and I actually hope you do read this back. Crying and my throat get's that tight pain that is so familiar to stress and anxiety. It's as frequent as the feeling you get when you are hungry or sleepy these days. You've welcomed it into the rotation or at least it seems that way, in any case I can't pinpoint the exact instance.

If you are not safe you should stop reading and seek help. Remember, you wrote SEEK HELP on a notepad once. And then waited YEARS before you did. But I don't blame you, don't worry. I understand. I always did but I was bad at empathizing with you back then. I am better now. But anyway, you should really stop now. If you're not safe stop. Am I not there for you though? That makes make me tear up again. I should be there. Please take a quick look around and tell me if I'm there. If I'm not then I really don't know where I went and I am sorry for not being there. Since I am not there in this scenario I can't help you and I hope you've developed other mechanisms for feeling safe or hopefully you are not alone. Right, you might have someone else with you who perhaps loves you and you love back. That'd be nice. If that's the case you cannot give up, simply not. If she's with you tell her that I love her too and that I wish her the best. Tell her that I apologize for the things she might have to put up with which are fundamentally my doing.

All those moments that just passed you by.
