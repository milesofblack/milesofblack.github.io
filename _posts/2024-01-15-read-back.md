I hope I never have to read this back. If I do, it will be one of the last things I do. Or it might be a hasty look back on what once seemed like an insurmountable task. A Sisyphean one, even though I only read the first 9 pages of that. Some nerve making light jokes considering being on the verge of suicide but that must be a slither of hope peaking out which I am not sure what effect will have on my future self reading this. Best bet would be on some sort of self hate and here is my pessimistic outlook peaking out. This back and forth is kind of tiring after a while but that only fuels the hating which is a familiar feeling hence one that sticks around.
