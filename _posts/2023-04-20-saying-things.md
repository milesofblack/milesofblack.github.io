You are saying things but they don't mean things. Or at least, they don't mean what you think they do.

"Is Johny working the bar today?", she asked. "Yeah, he's in today.", he said.
"Great, I love Johny.", she said glancing at the bar.

Johny? Who's Johny? I though his name was John. I could have sworn it was. It is usually an affectionate diminutive of the masculine given name John, says Wikipedia. So she might actually be talking about the person I know but perhaps she knows something about him I simply seem to have missed.
