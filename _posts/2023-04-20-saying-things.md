***You are saying things but they don't mean things. Or at least, they don't mean what you think they do.***

## Johny

"Is Johny working the bar today?", she asked. "Yeah, he's in today.", he replied.
"Great, I love Johny.", she said glancing at the bar.

Johny? Who's Johny? I thought his name was John. I could have sworn it was. It is usually an affectionate diminutive of the masculine given name John, says Wikipedia. So she might actually be talking about the same person but perhaps she knows something about him I simply seem to have missed. That must be it... Unless, her casual remark was used to convey a character(?) trait of hers. Great, we can now use the desired descriptor when talking about her, whatever that is. Is Johny ok though? She'll never know.


## Persons

>-Table of three, please.<br>
>-Three as in three individual people?<br>
>-What? Yes, me and these two.<br>
>-So you require one table then?<br>
>-Yes... Of course.<br>
>-This way, please.<br>
>-Thank you.<br>

Three as in three people. Seperate entities sitting at a table drinnking coffee and telling lies.The telling lies part is done involuntarily.




***You are doing things and they actually have the desired effect.***
